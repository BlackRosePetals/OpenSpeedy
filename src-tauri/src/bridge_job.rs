//! Kill-on-close job object for the bridge helper processes.
//!
//! `shutdown_bridges` only runs when Rust code gets a chance to run: a normal
//! exit through `RunEvent::Exit`, or Ctrl+C. A force-kill — Task Manager's "End
//! task", which is `TerminateProcess` — and a crash run no user code at all,
//! which used to leave `bridge64.exe` and `bridge32.exe` behind after the app
//! was gone.
//!
//! A job object carrying `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` moves that cleanup
//! into the kernel. When the last handle to the job closes, every process still
//! in it is terminated; the kernel closes a dying process's handles however it
//! died, without running any user code. So the bridges go away with the app even
//! when the app never gets to say goodbye.
//!
//! Only handles from processes this app spawned itself may be assigned — a job
//! close would terminate anything else put in here, including a game the user is
//! only speed-hacking.
